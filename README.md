# Monster_Raising_Simulator

A monster raising simulator inspired by aspects of Monster Rancher and Dwarf Fortress.
Currently working on a basic slime creature.

Controls:
Press S to spawn a slime (max of 3)
Press F to spawn food at mouse point (max of 3 plus an additional 3 per slime spawned (max of 12))

Slime will become hungry and seek out food as it's hunger reaches a certain level. 
When starving, health and aether will decrease.
